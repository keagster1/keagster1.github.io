<p>I didn&rsquo;t think at any point throughout college that I would end up applying for a job at John Deere - henceforth referred to as Deere. Deere was not a company I associated with a software engineering career path. I went to college in Illinois and the students were usually talking about working for insurance companies or FAANG companies (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google).</p>
<p>It was only because of my roomate/friend that I ever applied to JD. He, to my suprise, took an internship with Deere during one of the summers. Once he was back, he described his experience to me and it was leagues better than what everyone else at school was talking about.</p>
<p>It seemed like a dream job without the same level of competitiveness you typically find in FAANG companies. This is something that is gradually changing as Deere transitions to a Tech company but even now the interviews are not as over the top as you will find with those FAANG companies.</p>
<p>I was already close to graduation at that time so I didn&rsquo;t have time to apply for an internship. Instead I applied directly to John Deere&rsquo;s Early Development Program for IT (or IT EDP for short). One purchased suit, a overnight stay at a hotel, an evening dinner, 2 back to back hour long interviews, a HQ tour, and a seminar later and I was officially a John Deere employee.</p>
<p>This program has changed over the years but is still very much the primary way that Deere brings young talent into the company. During the time I was in it, the program consisted of two 18 month rotations where each rotation would have you working on a team. You had some control over where you would land up based on a preference system.</p>
<h2 id="first-rotation">
  First Rotation
  <a class="heading-link" href="#first-rotation">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>My first rotation was in IT HR where I learned SAP (a program I had never heard of before) and ABAP (a language I&rsquo;m not particularly enthusiastic about). This was also where I got my first feel for what working at a large company would feel like.</p>
<p>It was also at this time that a mysterious buzz word was starting to make it&rsquo;s rounds throughout the company &ldquo;Agile&rdquo;. For you technical folks, I&rsquo;m sure you know what this is. Perhaps you even shuttered at its mention. For everyone else, Agile is yet another framework for working on projects. Instead of spending one or more years planning and creating something before releasing it to a production environment, the focus is much more on delivering thin slices of functionality to get feedback early. My honest opinion is that it&rsquo;s a fine way to work but it&rsquo;s not without it&rsquo;s challenges - more on that in a separate post.</p>
<h2 id="second-rotation">
  Second Rotation
  <a class="heading-link" href="#second-rotation">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>My second rotation was an IT Auditor. This job was essentially just &ldquo;go here&rdquo; and &ldquo;ask these questions&rdquo;. To be honest I didn&rsquo;t really like this job but I appreciated the experiences I gained from it. I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I was not very good at this job. I mostly chose it as my next rotation because I specifically wanted to push myself outside my comfort zone - and outside my comfort zone it was. I struggled to relate to my teammembers and the work itself wasn&rsquo;t particularly my speed. There wasn&rsquo;t even programming as part of the job (I don&rsquo;t think IT EPD&rsquo;s can pick audit anymore). But I got through it, learned some things, and then graduated from the IT EDP into the team that I&rsquo;m still with today.</p>
<h2 id="current-job">
  Current Job

</h2>
<p>My current job is Senior Software Engineer on a team that supports a legacy workflow application while simultaneously creating it&rsquo;s replacement - an endeavor that requires expertese in many different technologies and programming languages.</p>
<p>When I first joined the team I was a regular Software Engineer and the team mostly focused on supporting the legacy SAP application. The product is very complex with many scenarios and two decades worth of business requirements tacted on. Even now I don&rsquo;t feel that I have a full grasp of it.</p>
<p>I stayed on the team and learned as much as I could. About a year ago I was able to get a promotion to Senior Software Engineer due to my positive impact on the team and that was around the time that I realized just how much I truly had to learn. I reached a point where my typical approach to working wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it. For most of my life I had good success with just showing up and doing well - no outside effort was really needed outside of a few specific cases (like spanish). With this new level of responsiblity, I realized that I needed to solidify my fundamentals or else my progress would be stunted.</p>
<p>The weird thing about being a Senior Software Engineer is that it&rsquo;s not actually that prestigious or far into the progression ladder. Senior is really only step 3 of like 7. Generally speaking it goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>EDP</li>
<li>Software Engineer</li>
<li>Senior Software Engineer &lt;&ndash; I&rsquo;m here</li>
<li>Staff Software Engineer</li>
<li>Senior Staff Software Engineer</li>
<li>and beyond: Architect track or in place promotions or management track.</li>
</ol>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong though, being a Senior Software Engineer is certainly something I&rsquo;m proud of but it feels more like I&rsquo;m still an &ldquo;expert beginner&rdquo;. Essentially I&rsquo;ve been reaffirming my foundations and gaining experience with the technologies that this team uses.</p>
<p>The project this team is working on has given me a curated upskilling experience in which I needed to start using AWS services (many services), GitHub Actions, TypeScript, Node.js, and so on. Not only that but our team has had quite a storm of people problems that I&rsquo;ve had the benefit/misfortune of living through. We&rsquo;ve had programming contractors who couldn&rsquo;t program (fired very quickly), UX designers that simply didn&rsquo;t show up for work along side some drama that I won&rsquo;t be getting into (again fired), and a slow down in productivity that had many reasons behind it with one main reason being differences on the team between senior members of the team.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t <em>really</em> have a dream job but right now the closest dream job I have is to be a manager. I enjoy working with others to help them progress in their career and help them be the best version of themselves. I enjoy establishing healthy and fun working environments. I love when work can be as fun or more fun than life outside of work. Some of the funniest jokes and interactions I have are from work. Since I also like programming, I&rsquo;m hoping to one day become an Engineering Manager - half technical, half people.</p>
