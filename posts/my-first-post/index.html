<p>Hello and welcome to my blog! I named this post Batman because, much like this post, Batman has no parents. Shout out to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ENHE5xdFSwx71u3fDH5Xw"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ThePrimeagen</a> for this joke. To be clear I have parents and they are great.</p>
<p>For my blog, I will be writing about my journey both as a Software Engineer but also as a person. I hope you enjoy the content I put out and I hope you learn something from it!</p>

<p>I was born in 1996 and grew up around the time where computers were starting to become mainstream. I still remember the dial-up modem sounds, VCR&rsquo;s, floppy disks, and I am nastoligic for older Window OS versions like XP and 7.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really latch on to technology as a passion until the magical day my mom bought me an Xbox 360 Arcade back in the 2000&rsquo;s. This, combined with a gradual growing interest in computers, resulted in what I am today - a moderatley successful Senior Software Engineer at a fortune 500 company.</p>
<p>At the time of writing this, I am about 6 1/2 years into my career as a Software Engineer. I&rsquo;m no longer a fresh college graduate but still have a lot to learn. In my past attempts at writing a blog I&rsquo;ve neglected to mention which company I actually work for and that is because I wanted to avoid any complications that may result in that.</p>
<p>Well no more I say!</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t think at any point throughout college or before that I would end up applying for and getting a job at John Deere (JD). JD was not a company I associated with programming. It was only because of my roomate/friend that I ever applied. He, to my suprise, took an internship with JD during one of the summers. Once he was back, he described his experience to me and it was leagues better than what everyone else at school was talking about.</p>
<p>It seemed the dream job without the same level of compettitiveness you typically find in FANG (Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Google) companies. This is something that is gradually changing as Deere transitions to a Tech company but even now the interviews are not as over the top as you will find with those FANG companies.</p>
<p>I was already close to graduation at that time so I didn&rsquo;t have time to apply for an internship. Instead I applied directly to John Deere&rsquo;s Early Development Program for IT (or IT EDP for short). This program has changed over the years but is still very much the primary way that Deere brings young talent into the company. During the time I was in it, the program consisted of two 18 month rotations where each rotation would have you working on a team. You had some control over where you would land up based on a preference system.</p>
<p>My first rotation was in IT HR where I learned SAP (a program I had never heard of before) and ABAP (a language I&rsquo;m not particularly enthusiastic about). This was also where I got my first feel for what working at a large company would feel like. At this time, JD still required business casual so I would wear kahkis and a sweater of some sort usually. It&rsquo;s worth noting that I apparently decided the &ldquo;Freshmen 15&rdquo; was too low a bar and decided to gorge myself to weighing about 230 pounds so I was a <em>bit</em> self concious. Anyways, while the business casual requirement wasn&rsquo;t my cup of tea I was happy that I didn&rsquo;t have to wear suites. I was told my many that it wasn&rsquo;t too long ago that suites were required - a symptom of the more old-school values the company used to have.</p>
<p>It was also at this time that a mysterious buzz word was starting to make it&rsquo;s rounds throughout the company &ldquo;Agile&rdquo;. For you technical folks, I&rsquo;m sure you know what this is. Perhaps you even shuttered at its mention. For everyone else, Agile is yet another framework for working on projects. Instead of spending one or more years planning and creating something before releasing it to a production environment, the focus is much more on delivering thin slices of functionality to get feedback early. My honest opinion is that it&rsquo;s a fine way to work but it&rsquo;s not without it&rsquo;s challenges - more on that in a separate post.</p>
<p>Anyways, my second rotation was an IT Auditor. This job was essentially just &ldquo;go here&rdquo; and &ldquo;ask these questions&rdquo;. To be honest I didn&rsquo;t really like this job but I appreciated the experiences I gained from it. I&rsquo;ll be the first to admit that I was not very good at this job. I mostly chose it as my next rotation because I specifically wanted to push myself outside my comfort zone - and outside my comfort zone it was. I struggled to relate to my teammembers and the work itself wasn&rsquo;t particularly my speed. There wasn&rsquo;t even programming as part of the job (I don&rsquo;t think IT EPD&rsquo;s can pick audit anymore) But I got through it, learned some things, and then graduated from the IT EDP into the team that I&rsquo;m still with - a full stack team that works on many things including a large project that has been very impactful to me.</p>
<p>When I first joined the team I was a regular Software Engineer. About a year ago I was able to get a promotion to Senior Software Engineer and that was when I realized just how much I truly had to learn. I reached a point where my typical approach to working wasn&rsquo;t going to cut it. For most of my life I had good success with just showing up and doing well - no outside effort was really needed outside of a few specific cases (like spanish). With this new level of responsiblity, I realized that I needed to solidify my fundamentals or else my progress would be forever limited.</p>
<p>I plan to go into a lot more detail about various pieces of my experience at Deere in separate posts but I wanted to give you a high level overview of my journey so far.</p>
